<h1>Chocolate cakes</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>7 tbsp unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing </li>
    <li>2 ⁄ 3 cup cocoa powder, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>11⁄4 cups sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease
        the cake pans and dust them with cocoa
        powder. By hand, or in an electric mixer,
        cream together the butter and sugar until
        light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating
        well after each addition, until well mixed.
        In a separate bowl, sift together the flour,
        cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
        In another bowl, mix together the cooled
        coffee, milk, and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Next, beat alternate spoonfuls of the dry
        and liquid ingredients into the cake batter.
        Once the mixture is well blended, divide it
        between the pans.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30–35 minutes, until the cake is
        springy to the touch and a skewer inserted
        into the middle comes out clean. Leave to
        cool in the pans for a few minutes, then
        turn out to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
    <li>For the frosting, melt the butter in a
        saucepan over low heat. Add the cocoa
        powder and continue to cook for a minute
        or two, stirring frequently. Allow the mixture
        to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Sift in the confectioner’s sugar, beating
            thoroughly to combine. Blend, adding the
            milk 1 tablespoon at a time, until smooth
            and glossy. Allow to cool (it will thicken),
            then use half to sandwich the cakes
            together and the remainder to decorate
            the top and sides of the cake. Finally, use
            a vegetable peeler to create chocolate
            shavings and scatter them evenly over
            the top of the cake.</li>

        Mix in the almonds, adding milk if too thick.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough into 2 and roll half out on
        a floured surface to a 5 x 14 1 ⁄ 2 in (12 x 36cm)
        rectangle. Cut into 3 x 5in (12cm) squares,
        then cut diagonally to make 6 triangles.
        Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Spread 1 tablespoon of the paste onto
        each triangle, leaving a 3 ⁄ 4 in (2cm) border
        along the 2 longest sides. Brush the borders
        with egg. Roll the croissant up carefully from
        the longest side toward the opposite point.</li>
    <li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment
        paper and put the croissants on them. Cover
        and put in a warm place for 1 hour, until soft
        and spongy. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
